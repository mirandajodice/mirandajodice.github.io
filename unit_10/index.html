		<h4>A little about myself:<br>
			I am a Graphic Design graduate from Rockland Community College. Throughout my studies, I have become proficient with the programs Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. As an art student, I have practiced and learned the major design principals and techniques to incorporate into my artwork! My interest within the art field are as follows, but are not limited to: pencil, pen and ink, charcoal, sharpie makers, gauche paint, acrylic paint, oil paint, pastels, watercolor, clay, graphic and logo designs, and jewlery making. In my spare time, more than often you can find me out in the middle of the woods on a hike, listening and exploring music, doodling, painting, reading, or drawing up floor plans. Ever since I was six years old, I would draw in my sketchpads rooms of houses rearranged in all types of different ways, add all the furniture in, and think of the colors within. I loved to see all the possibilities of a space, and still do! I have a knack for interior design, and I always find my way into Home Goods just to look around (and sometimes get myself into trouble). During my studies, I have taken Web Design classes and have become interested in the freedom of expression and technicality behind it all. Currently I have enrolled myself in General Assembly's courses to excel in the Web Design world. After completion, I hope to interconnect my Graphic Design and Web Design skills to provide beautiful services to the community. It would be an honor to leave my artists thumbprint on today's world.
